ProjectEuler4
=============
This project is intended as a free-form problem for a candidate to use to create sample code for review.  This particular problem is used because it is a straightforward problem that doesn't require any domain-specific or business-specific knowledge.  The solution should also be fairly quick to develop so that a candidate can focus on creating tests and code to showcase their ability.

Problem
-------
Project Euler #4 (http://projecteuler.net/problem=4) is defined as:

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.  Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Constraints
-----------
The solution must be found by creating a program to solve the problem.  The program should be written using an object-oriented programming language.  Unit tests should be included with the program.  If possible, the code should be written to utilize dependency injection with the classes involved.
